# pyuscope-kitchen

pyuscope community contributions. It's a bit chaotic, don't look under the hood, but someone still loves it

The barrier to commit the main pyuscope repo is a bit higher due to a combination of things:
* Anything in the main repo 
* The main repo requires a CLA. Some people and organizations may not be able to do this

| Item | pyuscope | pyuscope-kitchen |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| License | BSD | BSD (or more?) |
| Contributing | CLA + pull request | Pull request |
| Maintainer / testing | Labsmore | None / contribution author |
| Dependencies | Limited | Whatever you want |

Example contributions:
* pyuscope scripting plugin
* External applications using the HTTP server
* Out of tree microscope configs?

Labsmore will tag this when a corresponding pyuscope release is cut, but no guarantees will be made that they actually work together.
