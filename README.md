# pyuscope-kitchen

pyuscope community contributions. It's a bit chaotic, don't look under the hood, but someone still loves it

**NOTE: Labsmore does not offer any support/warranty on this repo! It is provided "as is." Use at your own risk!**

There is some level of barrier / friction to commit to the main pyuscope repo due to maintenance / testing burden along with licensing requirements. If you think of the main pyuscope repo like a "kernel" this repo is closer to "userspace" where most users should be playing with contributions.

Example contributions:
* pyuscope scripting plugin
* External applications using the HTTP server
* Out of tree microscope configs?

Labsmore will tag this when a corresponding pyuscope release is cut, but no guarantees will be made that they actually work together.
